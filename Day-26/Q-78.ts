// Question 78: Function Expressions vs. Function Declarations:
// Compare function expressions and declarations by creating one of
// each that performs the same task, such as squaring a number.

//function Declaration
//we make this function using function keyword
//this is hoisted mean we can call it before its declartion
function decalrefunc(num1: number, num2: number) {
  return num1 * num2; //return product of two number
}
console.log(decalrefunc(2, 8)); //result:16

//function Expression
//we make this function using let,const keyword
//this function is not hoisted its mean we can't we use it before its declartion.
let funcExpression = (num1: number, num2: number) => {
  return num1 * num2;
};
console.log(funcExpression(2, 3)); //result:6
